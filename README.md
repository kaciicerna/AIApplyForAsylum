This is the repository for the AIApplyForAsylum project, which provides tools for data processing and algorithm application for asylum applications.

## Installation

To properly set up the environment and run the algorithm, follow these steps.

### 1. Creating a Virtual Environment

#### Windows

Open Command Prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

#### MacOS/Linux

Open Terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Installing Dependencies

After creating the virtual environment, you need to install the required libraries. Run the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Running the Algorithm

Finally, execute the main script using this command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Upon successful completion of these steps, the algorithm should be running and ready to use.
